# Pacific EQ Mount

Welcome to the Pacific EQ Mount project repository! This project is inspired by the AlkaidMount project (https://github.com/alanzjl/AlkaidMount) and a video by [XYZ](https://youtu.be/k2GoMa2DpH8), which served as a foundation for the development of the Pacific EQ Mount. The Pacific EQ Mount aims to provide an open-source design for a German Equatorial Mount (GEM) for astronomy enthusiasts. The mount offers an affordable and accessible option for astrophotography and observation, allowing you to capture stunning images of the night sky.
